Java for various searching algorithms, including BFS, DFS, A*, Best-First, and Bidirectional searching algorithms.

Instructions for running this project: 
1. Enter the terminal.
2. Change to the CS5011-A1 directory.
3. Compile all source code
    javac *.java help/*.java informed/*.java startCode/*.java uninformed/*.java
4. Run the source code
    java A1main <DFS|BFS|AStar|BestF|BiD> <ConfID>

For example, if I want to use A* to find a path in JCONF00 problem, I should use
  java A1main AStar JCONF00
